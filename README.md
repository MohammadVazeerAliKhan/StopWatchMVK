## Introduction
Stop Watch is basically used for calculating time of an activity. I have created a simple Stop Watch using Vanilla Javascript.
* Users can start the timer by clicking the start button
* Users at any point of time can reset the timer to Zero and Start from the 0 seconds
* Users can also stop at a particular point of time and can resume the time using Start button again
